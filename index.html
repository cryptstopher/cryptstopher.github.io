	    <p>If you would like to meet one-on-one or via phone or Skype, here is
		my <a href="https://calendly.com/chris_s_m">Calendly
		link</a>, where you can view my current availability and schedule
		something.</p>

	    <h2>Contact</h2>
	    <p>I no longer reply to messages sent to my antiquated personal email
		account, and I'm not active on any social media. If you would like to
		notify me about something that might be of interest or to reach out
		about a special opportunity, I am in the process of setting up an inbound
		address. Stay tuned.</p>
